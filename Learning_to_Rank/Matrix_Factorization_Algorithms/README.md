# Matrix Factorization Algorithms
* How can you leverage Matrix Factorization Algorithms for ranking & recommendation?
* Some systems and applications may leverage Linear Regression as a base ranking algorithm. 
* However, with the idea that over time you may want to be able to change the weights of certain items you want to rank in your system, it is prudent to consider how to utilize an algorithm like Matrix Factorization to help with this issue of weight configurations.
* Matrix Factorization with Alternating Least Squares (ALS) is a very popular technique for candidate generation/selection (feature selection).
   * Often times the results of Matrix Factorization candidate generation are then incorporated into a Linear Regression model for ranking -- essentially a 2 stage system.
  * This actually is commonly used in a lot of systems and not that complicated, also allows for weight adjustments. 
* In addition, Matrix Factorization often helps with issues in Rec and Ranking Systems such as:

1. Scalability
2. Cold Start Problem

* Last but not least, there is an algorithm called **Factorization Machines** that combines ALS and Linear Regression and works OOTB on AWS and solves the cold start problem as well as scalability issues.


## Matrix Factorization
* This is a high-level overview of what this is.
* At a high level, Matrix factorization can be used for:

1) **Dimensionality Reduction**
  * Matrix factorization techniques can reduce the dimensionality of a large user-item matrix by representing it as a product of two or more smaller matrices. 
  * This reduction in dimensionality makes the problem more computationally efficient and potentially more accurate by capturing the underlying "taste dimensions" or latent features.  

2)  **Latent Feature Representation**
  * Matrix factorization allows representing users and items in a shared "taste space" or latent feature space. 
  * Each user is represented as a vector of their taste values, and each item is represented as a vector of the tastes it represents. 
  * This compact representation enables finding connections between users and items that may not have any direct interactions.  

3) **Very Optimal for Sparse Data**
  * Recommendation systems often deal with sparse user-item matrices, where most entries are missing or unknown (also known as the “cold start problem”. 
  * Matrix factorization techniques are well-suited for such sparse data, as they can effectively capture the underlying patterns and relationships without relying on explicit ratings or interactions for all user-item pairs.  

4) **Feature Selection and Ranking**
  * Matrix factorization can be useful for feature selection and ranking in recommendation systems.
  * The latent features learned through factorization represent the most relevant and informative aspects of the data, effectively performing feature selection. 
  * The importance of each feature can be determined by examining the corresponding entries in the factorized matrices.  

5) **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**
  * ALS is a popular algorithm for matrix factorization in recommendation systems. 
  * It works by alternately fixing one of the factorized matrices and solving for the other using least squares optimization. 
  * ALS is efficient, scalable, and can handle large, sparse datasets, making it a good choice for recommendation systems.  



## Why is matrix factorization can be more optimal than linear regression for candidate generation and feature selection/ranking?

1) **Handling Sparse Data**
  * Linear regression assumes all feature values are known and relies on explicit interactions between users and items. 
  * In contrast, matrix factorization can effectively handle sparse data with missing entries, which is common in recommendation systems.  

2) **Latent Feature Representation**
  * Matrix factorization learns latent features or taste dimensions, which can capture complex patterns and relationships that may not be directly observable in the raw data. 
  * Linear regression, on the other hand, relies on explicit feature engineering and may struggle to capture these latent representations.  

3) **Dimensionality Reduction**
  * By reducing the dimensionality of a user-item matrix, matrix factorization can effectively perform feature selection and ranking, identifying the most relevant features or taste dimensions. 
  * Linear regression may require explicit feature selection or regularization techniques to achieve a similar effect.  

4) **Scalability**
  * Matrix factorization algorithms like ALS are designed to scale well with large, sparse datasets, making them more suitable for recommendation systems with millions of users and items.  
 
* In summary, matrix factorization techniques, such as ALS, are well-suited for recommendation systems because they can:
  * Effectively handle sparse data
  * Learn latent feature representations
  * Perform dimensionality reduction and feature selection
  * Scale to large datasets
 
* These properties make matrix factorization often more optimal than linear regression for candidate generation, feature selection, and/or ranking in recommendation systems.




# Factorization Machines
* Factorization machines (FM) is a supervised algorithm that can be used for classification, regression, and ranking tasks. 

## What is a Factorization Machine? 
* Simply put the algorithm is a generalization of a linear regression model AND a matrix factorization model. 
* It can be considered as an extension of Linear Regression where apart from capturing linear relationships, higher-order relationships are also captured by introducing higher-order feature interactions using latent factorization.

## What are higher-order feature interactions?
* Higher-order interactions are the combined effect of 2 or more features on the target variable, where the impact is:
  * Not linear
  * Can’t be represented by the sum of individual feature effects
* As an example:
```
Let’s say we have classification data for whether a user will click on a homepage feature in an application. The feature-set has:
  * User-id
  * User Age
  * Feature Type
  * Feature-ID
  * Click or Not (label)

We might observe that the effect of “Feature Type” on the likelihood of a user clicking on the feature depends on the “User Age.” 
  * For example, certain users may be more likely to click on image features, while older users may prefer video or text features. 
  * This interaction implies that the impact of “Feature Type” is not uniform across all age groups. 
  * To capture this higher-order interaction, an algorithmic model needs to account for how “Feature Type” and “User Age” interact to influence the click rate.
```

* The FM model equation incorporates n-way interactions between features of various orders.
* The most prevalent configuration is the second-order model, which encompasses weights for individual features and interaction terms for every pair of features in the dataset.
* I will be explaining two-way interaction in this post.

## How do Factorization Machines capture high-order interactions that Linear Regression ignores?
* The Factorization Machine equation incorporates “n-way” interactions between features and various orders. 
* The most prevalent configuration is the second-order model, which most importantly does the following:
  * Handles specific weights for individual features and interaction terms for every pair of features in a dataset
