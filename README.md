# Semantic_Search_and_Recomendation_Systems---Techniques-Experiments-Projects
* Repository by Adam Lang

# Overview
* Search and Recommendation Systems are 2 very important parts of many applications today and are continuously evolving in their own directions but with significant overlap between the 2 domains.
* This repo is dedicated to these 2 domains and their crossovers.


# Search and Information Retrieval Evolution 
* Search has evolved over the years from simple keyword searches using algorithms such as BM25, to Page Rank algorithms, Information Retrieval techniques with indexing, Semantic search driven by vector embeddings, Hybrid search a combination of keyword and vector search, to Elastic Search, to now the more popular "LLM driven search". (This is not a complete list by any means but gives a general overview.)
* While LLM driven search seems to dominate the landscape these days purely by popularity, ease of access, and the idea that "LLMs can solve any problem", it is not a "one size fits all" approach and building search and recommendation systems often times involves combining multiple algorithmic approaches.
* It is important to understand what they are and when to use them.
